# ALX HTML & CSS Advanced Project

## Project Overview

This project is focused on advancing your skills in CSS and styling by recreating a webpage based on a professional design from Figma. The main goal is to build a visually appealing and responsive page by carefully applying CSS techniques learned in the HTML, advanced course.

## Objectives

- Translate the Figma design into a fully functional HTML & CSS webpage.
- Use semantic HTML5 elements for structure and accessibility.
- Apply advanced CSS properties to match the design, including typography, spacing, colors, and layout.
- Ensure responsive design principles are followed for various screen sizes.
- Incorporate downloaded images and custom fonts (`Source Sans Pro` and `Spin Cycle OT`) to match the design style.
- Handle fractional CSS values appropriately, rounding when necessary.
